= Introduction =

This document related to mvCentral release 1.0.1 (1st March 2012)

The purpose of this document is to help you understand how mvCentral interacts with the MediaPortal's skin engine. In this document you're going to find a general overview of how the plug-in is structured, the components that you, as a skinner should be interested in, and a list of available properties that you can use.

It's recommended that you use the DefaultWide (16:9) or Default (4:3) skin as a base which is installed with the release. It is written by the same people that write the plug-in, so if you are having trouble getting something to work right, refer to this skin.

If you want to see whats NEW in a particular version, search for the version throughout this page e.g. To see what has changed in v1.0.5, perform a search on term '1.0.5'.


== Translations ==

You can make use any of the plugins string translations to create button menus, headings, labels etc. Syntax for translations are just simple skin properties in the form #mvCentral.Translation.$(string).Label e.g.
|| *Property* || *English* ||
|| #mvCentral.Translation.Artists.Label || Artists ||
|| #mvCentral.Translation.FavouriteVideos.Label || Favourite Videos ||
|| #mvCentral.Translation.PlayAllRandom.Label || Play All (Random) ||
|| #mvCentral.Translation.Tracks.Label || Tracks ||

There is a wide selection of translated strings to choose from, [http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Language/mvCentral/en-US.xml here] is a complete list. Use the Field value in the skin property to get the translation you require.
