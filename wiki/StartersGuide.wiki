= Introduction =
Welcome to the starter's guide to mvCentral! Here we will go over a few of the basics to help you get started with mvCentral.

mvCentral is a Music Videos plugun for MediaPortal that scans your Music Video collection and looks up the metadata using Last.FM as the primary data source.

= Notes of Filename and Folder layout =

The plugin will support a base set of filenames and folder layouts. The parser is flexible and though the user of custom parsing and replacements is capable of supporting a wider range. The parsing engin and how to customize is detailed seperatly (TBS).

The basic format is 

*{{{<artist> - <track name>.<ext>}}}*

the - (hypen) is mandantory as is the order - the contents of Artist and Track Name are more flexible as these are cleaned by the parsing engine.

Filenames like the two are perfectly acceptable and the default expresssions will handle these sucessfully.

 * *Avril Lavigne [1080p] - Alice.mkv*
 * *Nicole Scherzinger - Wet (Official Music Video 2011).mkv*

Filenames like the two below will not parse using default expressions and custom expressions will need to entered.

 * *acdc-shoot_to_thrill-repack-proper-dvdrip-x264-2010-mv4u.mkv*
 * *alexandra_stan-get_back_(asap)-web-1080p-x264-2011-fray_int.mkv*

= Album Support =

The plugin can display you Music Vidoes similar to the native Music plugin, Artist, Album and Trackw. Album support is enabled by default and can be disabled if required.

Two methods are used to assoiate a track with the album, the first option is scraping from Last.FM (scraping), the second is by parsing the folder layout(parsing).

The scraping  method looks up the Album(s) that the track is found on from last.FM and returns the higest ranked, this can give unexcpected results due to the way Last.FM ranks albums. 

The parsing method will look at the folder layout i.e.
{{{
Guns n Roses
-Appetite For Destruction
--Track 1
--Track 2
--Track 3
-Use Your Illusion I
--Track 1
--Track 2
--Track 3
-Use Your Illusion II
--Track 1
--Track 2
--Track 3
}}}

This option can be disable and is neceassary if you use a folder layout based on Genre or similar.


= First Steps =

After installing the plugin, go to mvCentral's configuration in the plugins section of MediaPortal Configuration.

Once there, the first thing you should do is look over the *Importer Settings* settings tab (shown below).

You will see various options and we will go over most of them here:

*Auto Approve Settings*

|| *Auto approve if match found on scraper*||
||This enabled by default and will automaticlly approve the Music Video and download Information and Artowork if both Artist and Track match, if no extact match is found the Music Video will be marked for user approval||

*Album Support*
 
|| *Disable Album Support*||
||This will disable support for Album scraping and parsing||
 
|| *Enable scraping of Album from the the Track Data*||

|| *Use the scrapper for found album instead of the parsed one*||
||Scapping is enabled by default and selecting this option will use the parsed Album over the one that has been parsed||

*Parsing*

|| *Ignore folder structure when parsing*||
||Enabling this option will disable parsing for the Album from the folder layout||

*Data Sources*

|| *Automatically retrieve information in the _________ language*||
||This will allow you select the language that information is retrived from Last.FM, there are 7 defined languages. If your language is not listed chose addtional options and select your language. The information will then be run though the Google translate API - this option can lead to imprefect results.||

*Video Thumbnail*

||Prefer video thumbnail over parsed image for thumbnail||
||Enabling this option with use Movie Thumbnailer to extract an image from the Music Video, this image can have a number of row/cols if required which can be configured from the Video Apperance below||

= Importing Music Videos =

Once you have the plugin configured to the way you want it to look and act, let's select the "Import" tab to begin our initial import of songs.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/import-main.jpg]


As you can see the import tab has different sections each accessible on the left identifiable by the icons of: 

 * [http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/folder_image.png] Select the source(s) for you Music Vidoes
 * [http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/tick.png] Select the scan amd match tab.
 * [http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/pencil_add.png] This display the string replacements tab when you amend the replacements used pre and post parsing.
 * [http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/page_gear.png] This will access the parsing expressions tab when you edit and add parsing expressions. 
 
The bottom part is used as a pre parse checker to make sure you donâ€™t have any incompatible naming issues with your files. This screen is best used after the initial scan when there are outstanding items as it will allow you to check the parse results.

The first stage is to add the folder containing your Music Video collection, you can add multiple folders if you wish.

Import will start immediatly you add a folder and you will switched to the importer screen.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/ImportFiles.jpg]

Here we have our importer results. In this image there is an import in progress, the plugin is currently going though and attempting to identify the Artist and Track. The processing section show the current file being processed, an indication of how far though and the total number of number of imported Music Videos/Total Music Video found.

When the scan is completed the processing will either say *Done!* if all scanned sucessfully of *Waiting for Close Match Approvals...* indicating manual approval is required.

The screen below show a finished import that is waiting for approvals and indicates that there are 7 items waiting to be manually approved.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/waitingApproval.jpg]

In this image you can see that 3 songs were not imported correctly indicated by the [http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/Information.png] icon.

The first of these has no possible matches, the second and third have matches but these did not meet the ranking for auto approval.

= Manually Approving of Imported Music Videos =

There are 3 icons above the main list on import files;

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/tick.png]    *Accept suggested match.*

This option will mark Music Video as approved using the suggested name, this is the option we would use for the 2nd and 3rd items in the example above.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/Edit.png]    *Manually enter the details for the Music Video.*

This option allows you to enter the details of a Music Video manually, selecting this option will bring the following screen.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/manualImport.jpg]

Here you can enter the details of the Artist, Album and Track. A Music Video that is entered this way will not pick up any metadata of artwork and should be used when the plugin is unable to identify the Music Video using the Custom string or you are importing DVD's.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/find.png]    *Rescan using Custom Search string.*

This option allows you to reneter/correct the parsed information, clicking on the icond will display the follwoing screen.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/rescanCustom.jpg]

Using the earlier example we can see that the track has been identified as *Rubber Bullets Live* and this track has not been found. We can correct this, removing the word *Live* and clicking *Ok* whcih will resend the filer back to the importer.

Most approvals will use this method.  


== Advanced Import Options ==


 * [http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/pencil_add.png] This display the string replacements tab when you amend the replacements used pre and post parsing.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/import-replacements.jpg]



 * [http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/page_gear.png] This will access the parsing expressions tab when you edit and add parsing expressions.

[http://mvCentral.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/import-parsing.jpg]





Now that is all done let's take a look at the library you have started by clicking on the "Library" tab.

http://www.mp-pr.com/images/wiki/6.png

Here you can go over your video selection and make any changes like:
 * Image selection for artists and tracks
 * Edit summary, title, tags and language info
 * Regroup video ordering
 * And more...

Okay I think you are ready to enjoy mvCentral and your music video collection. Good luck!!!!
